                The metaphoric expression, "Life is Just a Bowl of Cherries," dates back to the 1920's when it was first stated in a New York newspaper.  
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                It means that life is short and we aren't here to stay, so we shouldn't take life too seriously.  We should make the most of our lives by enjoying our experiences.  
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The song explains philosophically about laughing with these cherries of life (the bountiful wins and losses) and in the end, what is all our hard work for is we aren't happy through it all?  
                As long as the cherries are sweet, life is good, but when we reach down into the bowl and draw out a bitter sour, one? What then? Remember to have to sense of humor when it comes to life's circumstances, especially when something doesn't go your way, and live a happy, carefree life.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                What's more fun and joyous than enjoying life's experiences with the ones you love?
